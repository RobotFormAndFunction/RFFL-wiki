## Soldering Supplies Documentation 

The following is a brief introduction to using soldering supplies in the lab. It describes common soldering tools, how to use them, and where they live in the lab. 

The following tools are in the drawer labelled soldering supplies under the RAISE 3D printer 

## solder 

Used to connect metal components in the lab. comes in a spool and cardboard case. Some of these do contain lead, so try not to  inhale solder smoke or eat food while using. When done it is a good idea to wash your hands (but it's not mandatory)

## solder sucker 
This tool is used to remove excess solder from a surface. To use, push down the button at the top, place the tip at the location of solder to remove, and press button on the side to release 

## copper wick 
Another tool to correct excess solder: place the end of the wick at the location of interest after applying heat with soldering pen. Alternatively, heat wick and place on area. Try to keep the wick clean of solder, as this will impact its use 

## solder flux 
great for guiding solder to where you want to go, or attaching small components. Place on parts you want solder to flow and solder normally. Apply less than you think you need. 

## wire stripper 
This is used to remove the outer coating of wires. Use the gauge/diameter measurements to find the correct throughhole. Gently pry the outer covering of the wire by twisting and pulling it off. If the measurement is unknown, start at the bottom measurement and work upwards until you can hold the wire but not cut it 



The following is in the fridge under the soldering station. This fridge is marked only to contain chemical components 

## thermal paste 
used to place components and dissipate heat between components and pcb board. Paste is applied and then heated, usually with a hot plate 


The following is on the table of the soldering station 


## hot plate 
a surface that prepared components can be set on to be heated to have flux, solder, and thermal paste set in properly. charged with a type C cable, and operated via a touch screen 


## soldering pen 
Used to heat up solder and attach components. Use a switch to turn on and wait a few minutes to heat up. Make sure not to touch the tip, and turn off the pen when finished. For the blue soldering pen, there is an extra switch on its back to fully turn off both the pen and the heat gun. The tip of the soldering pen is cleaned using the metal/brass mesh accompanying it. Use this to clean the tip after and during use. To clean the pen, press the tip into the mesh and twist until the tip no longer has solder. You can also do this when it seems the pen is not functioning properly. 

To use the soldering pen, here are two of many methods

1. Place the solder at the desired location and then heat the solder with the pen 
2. Touch the solder to the tip of the pen and have it coat the tip, then place the tip on the desired area (clean the tip when you are done) 

## optical lens 
This is used to look at small components more closely and solder extremely small parts. The knobs 

## heat gun 
This tool uses hot air to seal heat shrink or rapidly heat components. It has its own switch to activate. Do not apply to surfaces for too long because it will melt plastic.
