## Soldering Supplies Documentation 

The following is a brief introduction to using soldering supplies in the lab. it describes common soldering tools, how to use them and where they live in the lab. 

The following tools are in the drawer labelled soldering supplies under the RAISE 3D printer 

## solder 

Used to connect metal compoments in the lab. comes in a spool and cardboard case. Some of these do contain lead, so try not to breathe the solder in while using, clean hands after using and do not eat while using

## solder sucker 
This tool is used to remove excess solder from a surface. To use push down the button at the top, place the tip at the location of solder to remove, and press button on the side to release 

## copper tape 
another tool to correct excess solder, place the end of the wick at the location of interest after applying heat with soldering pen. Alternatively heat wick and place on area. Try to keep the wick clean of solder, as this will impact its use 

## solder flux 
great for guiding solder to where you want to go, or attaching small compoments. place on parts you want solder to flow and solder normally. apply less than you think you need. 

## wire stripper 
this is used to remove the outer coating of wires. use the guage/diameter measurements to find the correct throughole. gently pry the outer covering of the wire by twisting and pulling it off. If the measurement is unknown, start at the bottom measurement and work upwards until you can hold the wire but also not cut it 



the following is in the fridge under the soldering station. this fridge is marked only to contain chemical components 

## thermal paste 
used to place components and dissapate heat between component and pcb board. pase is applied and then heated usually with hot plate 


the following is on the table of the soldering station 


## hot plate 
a surface that prepared components can be set on to be heated to have flux, solder and thermal paste set in properly. charges with type C cable, and operated via a touch screen 


## soldering pen 
used to heat up solder and attach components. use a switch to turn on and wait a few minutes to heat up. make sure not to touch the tip, and turn off the pen when finished. for the blue soldering pen, there is an extra switch on its back to fully turn off both the pen and the heat gun . The tip of the soldering pen is cleaned using the metal/brass mesh acompanying it, use this to clean the tip after and during use . to clean the pen, press the tip into the mesh and twist until tip no longer has solder. you can also do this when it seems the pen is not functioning properly. 

to use the soldering pen, here are two of many methods

1. place the solder at the desired location and then heat the solder with the pen 
2. touch the solder to the tip of the pen and have it coat the tip, then place the tip on the desired area (clean the tip when you are done) 

## optical lens 
this is used to look at small components more closely, twist the corresponding knobs to get the view you want 

## heat gun 
this tool uses hot air to seal heat shrink or rapidly heat components. it has its own switch to activate. do not apply to surfaces for too long because it will melt plastic.
